	abstract = {We present a type of agent-based model that uses off-lattice spheres to represent individual cells in a solid tumor. The model calculates chemical gradients and determines the dynamics of the tumor as emergent properties of the interactions between the cells. As an example, we present an investigation of cooperation among cancer cells where cooperators secrete a growth factor that is costly to synthesize. Simulations reveal that cooperation is favored when cancer cells from the same lineage stay in close proximity. The result supports the hypothesis that kin selection, a theory that explains the evolution of cooperation in animals, also applies to cancers.},

	abstract = {Accurately modeling the {DNA} sequence preferences of transcription factors ({TFs}), and using these models to predict in vivo genomic binding sites for {TFs}, are key pieces in deciphering the regulatory code. These efforts have been frustrated by the limited availability and accuracy of {TF} binding site motifs, usually represented as position-specific scoring matrices ({PSSMs}), which may match large numbers of sites and produce an unreliable list of target genes. Recently, protein binding microarray ({PBM}) experiments have emerged as a new source of high resolution data on in vitro {TF} binding specificities. {PBM} data has been analyzed either by estimating {PSSMs} or via rank statistics on probe intensities, so that individual sequence patterns are assigned enrichment scores (E-scores). This representation is informative but unwieldy because every {TF} is assigned a list of thousands of scored sequence patterns. Meanwhile, high-resolution in vivo {TF} occupancy data from {ChIP}-seq experiments is also increasingly available. We have developed a flexible discriminative framework for learning {TF} binding preferences from high resolution in vitro and in vivo data. We first trained support vector regression ({SVR}) models on {PBM} data to learn the mapping from probe sequences to binding intensities. We used a novel -mer based string kernel called the di-mismatch kernel to represent probe sequence similarities. The {SVR} models are more compact than E-scores, more expressive than {PSSMs}, and can be readily used to scan genomics regions to predict in vivo occupancy. Using a large data set of yeast and mouse {TFs}, we found that our {SVR} models can better predict probe intensity than the E-score method or {PBM}-derived {PSSMs}. Moreover, by using {SVRs} to score yeast, mouse, and human genomic regions, we were better able to predict genomic occupancy as measured by {ChIP}-chip and {ChIP}-seq experiments. Finally, we found that by training kernel-based models directly on {ChIP}-seq data, we greatly improved in vivo occupancy prediction, and by comparing a {TF}'s in vitro and in vivo models, we could identify cofactors and disambiguate direct and indirect binding.},

	abstract = {Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy performed on surface-supported bilayer membranes allows for the monitoring of changes in membrane properties, such as thickness, ion permeability, and homogeneity, after exposure to antimicrobial peptides ({AMPs}). We show that two model cationic peptides, very similar in sequence but different in activity, induce dramatically different changes in membrane properties as probed by impedance spectroscopy. Moreover, the impedance results excluded the "barrel-stave" and the "toroidal pore" models of {AMP} mode of action, and are more consistent with the "carpet" and the "detergent" models. The impedance data provide important new insights about the kinetics and the scale of the peptide action which currently are not addressed by the "carpet" and the "detergent" models. The method presented not only provides additional information about the mode of action of a particular {AMP}, but offers a means of characterizing {AMP} activity in reproducible, well-defined quantitative terms.},
